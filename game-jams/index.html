      <p>While I was a student at Penn State University, I was an officer in the Game Development Club
and facilitated several weekend game jam events where students would build games based on a theme.</p>
<p>Here are the games I created during these events using <a href="https://slick.ninjacave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">Slick2D</a> for Java.</p>
<h2 id="look-beyond">Look Beyond</h2>
<p><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/look-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">Look Beyond</a>
is the game I submitted for the 2014 Global Game Jam based on the theme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see things as they are, we see them as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I experimented with the idea of how our emotions can affect our preception of the world
around us, though looking back I recognize that it did not have the healthiest view on
how to actually process and deal with those emotions.</p>
<p>You can watch a playthough of the game here:</p>

<h2 id="snow">Snow</h2>
<p>Snow is the game I created for for the Penn State Fall 2013 Game Jam based on the theme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winter&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a simple game where you control the wind to push and grow a snowball.
The larger the snowball, the higher it can jump. Rolling the snowball through
a fire will melt and shrink the snowball until it disappears.</p>
<p>You can watch a demonstration of the game and early development footage here:</p>

<h2 id="blood-pumping-adventure">Blood-Pumping Adventure!</h2>
<p>Blood-Pumping Adventure! is the game I submitted for the 2013 Global Game Jam based on the theme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heartbeat&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a simple rhythm game that asks the player to consistently pump a heart to the
beat of the music to get a blood cell to its destination and deliver its precious cargo of oxygen.</p>
<p>You can watch development footage and a final demonstration here:</p>
